## Course Description

ChatGPT now supports apps - integrations to external services that add context, content, and even UI elements to the conversation. In this course you’ll learn how to build your own apps. You can build your own ChatGPT apps using OpenAI’s Apps SDK and MCP, allowing users to call in your app during a chat and you to control what tools, context, UI, and other capabilities your app should add. The Apps SDK gives you the power to add content from your service, including text, images, video, and interactive interfaces to ChatGPT while you retain full control over user access and user experience.
