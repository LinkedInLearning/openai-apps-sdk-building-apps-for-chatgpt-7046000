## Course Description

ChatGPT now supports apps - integrations to external services that add context, content, and even UI elements to the conversation. In this course you’ll learn how to build your own apps. You can build your own ChatGPT apps using OpenAI’s Apps SDK and MCP, allowing users to call in your app during a chat and you to control what tools, context, UI, and other capabilities your app should add. The Apps SDK gives you the power to add content from your service, including text, images, video, and interactive interfaces to ChatGPT while you retain full control over user access and user experience.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
